The .defaultSuccessUrl("/home", true) method:
.defaultSuccessUrl("/home", true) configures where Spring Security should redirect a user after a successful login. The method takes two parameters:

The first parameter ("/home" in this case) is the URL to redirect to after a successful login.
The second parameter (true in this case) is a boolean that determines the redirect behavior.

The boolean parameter is particularly important:

When set to true:

The user will always be redirected to the specified URL ("/home") after a successful login, regardless of where they were trying to access before being prompted to log in.
This is useful when you want users to always land on a specific page (like a dashboard) after logging in.


When set to false (or omitted, as false is the default):

If the user was trying to access a specific page before being prompted to log in, they will be redirected to that original page after successful authentication.
If there was no prior request (e.g., user went directly to the login page), then they will be redirected to the specified URL.



Example scenarios:

With true:

User tries to access /profile, gets redirected to login
After successful login, user goes to /home


With false:

User tries to access /profile, gets redirected to login
After successful login, user goes back to /profile


With false, but direct login:

User goes directly to login page
After successful login, user goes to /home



This method allows you to control the post-login user experience, balancing between a consistent landing page and preserving the user's intended destination.
